Site Description:

Hey there! My name is Java_da_worm--that's jaw - va - duh - were - m, thank you very much. If you're anything like my pals who created me, Java errors are the bane of your existence: 
I exist because of these errors, so, I guess I should be excited about them. For some reason, however, I have been programmed to hate the very thing that gives me existence! Oh my...
I guess I'm something of an existentialist: I exist to nullify my existence. Anyways, let me take you through my suicidal programming, er... thoughts:

First, this application will differentiate between two different errors: those which are pre testing, and those which are post. When you click on an error type, you will be directed to a list of errors
which Java users have populated over the eons. 

Once you have been directed to the appropriate page, you will have the option of clicking on the particular error you are being troubled by. This is where I come in: I will generate for you a solution, randomly,
which will you--ultimately--remove my existence. I guess that's all that needs to be said. Well... that and something about Nietzsche's thoughts on eternal recursion.

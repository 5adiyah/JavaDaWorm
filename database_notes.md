STATIC METHODS
  Name: Non-static & Static Contexts
  Type: pre
  tag: static

  Solution: Static methods expect returns. Did you return anything? Anything at all?

CANNOT FIND SYMBOL
  Name: Cannot Find Symbol
  Type: pre
  tag: Cannot Find Symbol

  Solution: Have you imported all your dependencies? Java isn't a mind reader.
  Solution: I know you think it exists, but it doesn't. You probably spelled something wrong. Or you just forgot to write an entire method. Dummy.

  Solution: Check your terminal, dude. I can't fix everything for you.

PSQLException
  Name: PSQLException
  Type: pre
  tag: sql

  Solution: Does that table exist? No, really, I know you think it does. Did you spell it right? Java ain't a mind reader.
  Solution: Did you create a test database? Do you know how? Here goes:
  CREATE DATABASE database_test WITH TEMPLATE database; *REMEMBER THE SEMICOLON*
  Solution: When you created your tables, were you actually in your database? If you're floating out in the sql nether, the tables won't apply correctly. Change to your database with \c database_name;
  Solution: When you were creating your database, did you close all your semi-colons or did you just keep carrying on with your ADDs and your DELETEs like sql didn't care.
  Solution: Check your terminal, dude. I can't fix everything for you.
  Solution: Have you tried this new thing, I think, it's called, like, Google? Like, maybe use that? And stop bothering me about it?

GRADLE:

  Solution: Check your terminal, dude. I can't fix everything for you.
  Solution: Have you tried this new thing, I think, it's called, like, Google? Like, maybe use that? And stop bothering me about it?


VARIABLES:
  Name: VARIABLES
  Type: pre
  tag: variables

  Solution: I have to ask, is the variable actually what you think it is? CaSe MaTtErS. Extras s's ares a problems.
  Solution: Java cares. Specifically, Java cares about data types remaining the same. Did YOU care?
  Solution: Did you actually instantiate the variable correctly? Like, with a type, and with a meaning? Please give your variable meaning. And then close it off with a semi-colon.
  Solution: Check your terminal, dude. I can't fix everything for you.
  Solution: Does that variable already exist? If you use the same one without meaning to, you give the poor thing an identity crisis. It just wants to know what you want.
  Solution: Have you tried this new thing, I think, it's called, like, Google? Like, maybe use that? And stop bothering me about it?
